Version 1.7

ericb 2017 September 10th 

Created github repository

ericb 2017 June 25th

Added -fno-builtin-memset gcc option, to protect memset use (there is no memset_s() yet on Linux))

Version 1.6

ericb 2017 March 12th
Removed QA stuff. Keep only bAsk in the prototypes

ericb 2016 May 26th
Fixed some typos in the documentation

ericb 2016 May 25th
Code cleanup, and some cosmetics

Version 1.5

ericb 2016 May 24th
Documentation update
Added a protection when min > max in saisie_nombre* calls
To help tracking buffer overflows, the optimization level is now 3 ( -O3 )
Improved QA tests list
Splitted saisie_nombre.c into saisie_nombre_entier.c + saisie_nombre_reel.c
Replaced initialize_gbuf() with initialize_string() + use of memset instead of nulling an array (slower)
Hit several buffer overflows (size of strings need some rework)
Simplified saisie_nombre, using initialize_string systematicaly
Added limits in the while loop, to securize calcule_signe
Limited all loops to the real string size (before was MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, less efficient)

Version 1.4

ericb 2016 May 11th
Added initialize_g_buf() to clean the global buffer every time, AND transparently (no need to care about it)
Added calcule_signe() : we now can type whatever number of +- signs. e.g. +---+12  = -12

Version 1.3

ericb 2016 April 30th
Fixed the remaining default zero value, when entering a simple "\n"

Version 1.2

ericb 2016 April 12th
Fixed more issues when entering bad numbers, including infinite loop
because bString_Is_OK not correctly used in logical value

ericb 2016 April 2nd
Fixed: renamed buf in g_buf becasue it's a global array.

Version 1.1
